# Quantum-networks
These are my simulations using Netsquid.


The items above are the simulations I created in order to study the behaviour of a quantum network under different situations. Most of the simulations are to study the efficency of the network with fiber attenuation or depolaritation errors or both at the same time.

The simulations were created using the examples present in the tool as models. The tool can be found here: [https://netsquid.org/](url)

The simulations were created in 2021.

Some codes are broken or do not work. I can not tell which works and which not as I have to try them but I did not have time to do that yet. My objective is to test all of them in the future but I do not think that future will be near.
